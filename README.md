Example of Genetics Algorithm for AI University's task completion

Disclaimer: The roulette function is still not working, it still on my TODOs list. But any of that feel free to break the program. Oh yeah, this is created purely on Javascript :p

Sorry for the incovenient, will work in remaining funcionality such as:
 - Delta F for getting more accurate score
 - Roulette function on parent selection step
